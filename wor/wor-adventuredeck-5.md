## The Corruption Demon is displayed next to my deck. Do I have to decide whether or not I'm burying cards before I roll to find out how many need to be buried?

Roll first, then decide.

Resolution: On the monster Corruption Demon, change the last sentence to "At the start of your turn, roll 1d4; you may bury that number of cards to banish this card."

## Does Elemental Bombardment really wait till the end of the turn to discard itself?

No, it happens after whatever check you use it on.

## Should all boons that reference mythic charges have the Mythic trait?

They do, with the exception of 4 boons in adventure deck 5. Mechanically speaking, the only powers that reference the Mythic trait affect only banes with that trait, so this is completely cosmetic, but for consistency's sake, those 4 boons really should have the trait.

Resolution: On the item Torc of the Heavens and the loots Ball of Twine, Chalice of Ozem, and Dawnflower's Kiss, add the Mythic trait.
