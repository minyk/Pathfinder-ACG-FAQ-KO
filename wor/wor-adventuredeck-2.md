# Card Questions: Sword of Valor (Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Deck 2)

## In The Siege of Drezen, when I build each location deck, do I include henchmen? When I build the Citadel, do I include the cards from the previous location deck?

Here's what's going on in non-technical terms: During setup, build only the first location, which should include its regular card list plus a Worldwound Cadre.When you close that, build the next listed location using its regular card list, plus a Worldwound Cadre, plus all the leftover cards from the previous location. Repeat that until you close the last location listed for your number of characters. Then set out the Citadel. Shuffle together the villain, one Brimorak per character, and the leftover cards from the last location. (Note you are ignoring the Citadel's card list and you are not adding a Worldwound Cadre this time.)

Resolution: On the scenario The Siege of Drezen, replace During This Scenario with the following text:

When setting up, build only the first location. Before closing a location, summon and build the next location, add a henchman, then shuffle the current location deck into it. Before closing the final location listed for your number of players, set out the location Citadel, add the villain Soltengrebbe and 1 henchman Brimorak per character, then shuffle the current location deck into it. To win the scenario, defeat Soltengrebbe.

## Nulkineth cares about my "Divine bonus." What is that?

That should be your Divine modifier. (If your character card says "Wisdom: d12 +1", and “Divine: Wisdom +2,” the modifier for your Divine skill is +3.)

Resolution: On the villain Nulkineth, change "Divine bonus" to "Divine modifier".

## If Theruk Nul would deal me damage, am I dealt the damage?

Yes. You just discard from your deck instead of your hand.

Resolution: On the henchman Theruk Nul, change "While you act, when you would be dealt damage by Theruk Nul, discard that number of cards from the top of your deck instead of your hand" to "While you act, when you are dealt damage by Theruk Nul, discard cards from the top of your deck instead of your hand".

## When I use Planar Tuning Fork, and the location I'm at already has an "At This Location" power on the closed side, am I augmenting that power or replacing it?

You're replacing it.

Resolution: On the item Planar Tuning Fork, add the italicized text to the following sentence: "While displayed, treat the closed location as if it had the At This Location power from the displayed card, and ignore any such power on the original location card."
