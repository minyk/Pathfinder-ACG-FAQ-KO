# Card Questions: Demon's Heresy (Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Deck 3)

## The scenario Crusader's Legacy and the henchman Alrys Harnaste each tell me contradictory things to do when I defeat Alrys. Is that intended?

Noâ€”the scenario should tell you what to do when you would banish him.

Resolution: On the scenario Crusader's Legacy, change the last power to "When you would banish Alrys Harnaste, shuffle him into a random open location deck."

## In The Demon's Redoubt, you add Grimslakes to the top of the location deck before you add the villain and henchmen, so they get shuffled in. Is that right? And are you meant to put a Grimslake on top of the Tower of the Fourth Sphere deck?

You should shuffle the villain and henchmen in first, then add the Grimslakes to the top. And you should only add the Grimslakes during setup, not whenever you build a location.

Resolution: On the scenario The Demon's Redoubt, change "After you build location decks, put a Grimslake henchman on top of each one" to "After you add the villain and henchmen to the location decks, put a Grimslake henchman on top of each".

## Only one of my checks to defeat the Drake Rider has the Force or Ranged trait. Do I get to add 5 to the check that doesn't?

Nope.

Resolution: On the monster Drake Rider, change "If you succeed at an Intelligence or Knowledge 12 check, or if your check has the Force or Ranged trait, add 5 to your checks to defeat it" to "On each check to defeat, if you succeed at an Intelligence or Knowledge 12 check, or if the check has the Force or Ranged trait, add 5."
