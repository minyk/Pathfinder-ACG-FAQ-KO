# Card Questions: Demon's Heresy (Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Deck 3)

## The scenario Crusader's Legacy and the henchman Alrys Harnaste each tell me contradictory things to do when I defeat Alrys. Is that intended?

Noâ€”the scenario should tell you what to do when you would banish him.

Resolution: On the scenario Crusader's Legacy, change the last power to "When you would banish Alrys Harnaste, shuffle him into a random open location deck."

## Only one of my checks to defeat the Drake Rider has the Force or Ranged trait. Do I get to add 5 to the check that doesn't?

Nope.

Resolution: On the monster Drake Rider, change "If you succeed at an Intelligence or Knowledge 12 check, or if your check has the Force or Ranged trait, add 5 to your checks to defeat it" to "On each check to defeat, if you succeed at an Intelligence or Knowledge 12 check, or if the check has the Force or Ranged trait, add 5."
