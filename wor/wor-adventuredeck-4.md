# Card Questions: The Midnight Isles (Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Deck 4)

## Brutalized Flesh Golem is only displayed if it gets into your hand via Skinstitcher's Manual. What if it gets into my hand some other way? Also, it seems like its powers should only function while displayed.

Yeah, those need some help.

Resolution: On the item Skinstitcher's Manual, change the first sentence of the first power to "Bury this card to draw the cohort Brutalized Flesh Golem from the box." On the cohort Brutalized Flesh Golem, change the power to the following:

You may display this card. While displayed, you may recharge this card to reduce damage other than Combat damage dealt to a character at your location to 0, or discard this card to explore your location; if you discard it, during this exploration, banish any boons you encounter and add 1d6 plus your number of mythic charges to your combat checks. While displayed, at the end of your turn, if you have mythic charges, banish this card.

## Demondome says "When 1 of these location decks is empty, close that location". Does that first part apply only when exactly 1 deck is empty? And does "close that location" mean "attempt to close" or "automatically close"?

The first part applies when any of the location decks is empty. And it closes automatically.

Resolution: On the scenario Demondome, change the text quoted in the question to "When any of these location decks is empty, that location automatically closes".

## In Nocticula's Attention, do I have to win at the moment that the number of displayed Blessings of Nocticula is greater than or equal to the number of characters?

Nope. If you want to try to keep farming those blessings, you're welcome to—but the consequences of that decision are all on you!

Resolution: On the scenario Nocticula's Attention, change "You win the scenario only when the number of Blessing of Nocticula cards displayed is greater than or equal to the number of characters" to "When you display a Blessing of Nocticula next to this scenario, if the number displayed is at least equal to the number of characters, you may win the scenario".

## I'm at Battlebliss. If I succeed (by 12 or more) at my first check to defeat a Demon that has multiple checks to defeat, can I attempt to close the location before I attempt the second check?

No—you can only attempt to close after you defeat the monster.

Resolution: On the location Battlebliss, change "When you succeed at a check to defeat a monster that has the Demon trait by 12 or more, you may attempt to close your location" to "When you succeed at a check to defeat a monster that has the Demon trait by 12 or more, after defeating it you may attempt to close your location".

## If I'm moved by Rapture of Rupture, can't I just move right back?

That would be a pretty useless power!

Resolution: On the location Rapture of Rupture, change "move to a random location" to "move to a random location and you may not move during your move step".

## Heart of the Fane says "If undefeated, and if the location Grinder is open, the villain does not escape." What if the Grinder is temporarily closed?

Normally, temporarily closing a location doesn't do anything other than prevent the villain from escaping to that location, but we do want this power to apply when the Grinder is temporarily closed.

Resolution: On the villain Heart of the Fane, change "if the location Grinder is open" to "if the location Grinder has not been banished and is not temporarily closed".

## On Abyssal Shortcut, who does "you" refer to: the person who defeated the barrier, or whoever's at the location where Abyssal Shortcut is displayed?

The latter.

Resolution: On the barrier Abyssal Shortcut, change the second power to "While displayed, immediately after a character at this location resolves an encounter, he may roll 1d6. On an even result, he may move. On an odd result, discard that many cards from the blessings deck."

## Can Climber’s Gloves be used every time I shuffle a location deck?

Not quite. It can only be used once per check or step.

Resolution: On the item Climber’s Gloves, add the following sentence to the end of the second power: ”You may not use this power more than once per check or step.”
