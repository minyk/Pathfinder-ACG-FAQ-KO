# Rules Questions

## When you're told to ignore something, does everybody ignore that thing, or just you?

Just you.

Resolution: On page 2 of the rulebook, in the Golden Rule, change "if a card tells you to ignore something, the thing you’re ignoring never has any effect" to "if a card tells you to ignore something, the thing you’re ignoring never has any effect on you". (See this FAQ entry for more about "you.")

## In the example under Add Villains and Henchmen, why do I leave out the Wights?

The example should have mentioned that it was for 3 locations.

Resolution: On page 7 of the rulebook, under Add Villains and Henchmen, change "If your scenario card listed Karsos as the villain and Ghalcor, Unfettered Eidolon, and Wights as henchmen, you’ll make a stack of just the first 3, leaving the Wights in the box" to "If you have 3 locations and your scenario card listed Karsos as the villain and Ghalcor, Unfettered Eidolon, and Wights as henchmen, you’ll make a stack of just the first 3, leaving the Wights in the box". Note: This resolution was incorporated into PDF Edition 1.0 of the rulebook.

## When I'm told to "draw a card," do I get to choose the card?

It depends on where you're drawing from. If it's a facedown deck, draw the top card. If it's a faceup pile, choose. If it's the box, draw a random card of the appropriate type (unless we told you to draw a specific card, of course).

Resolution: On page 9 of the rulebook, add this text at the end of the Drawing Cards sidebar: "When you draw a card from a facedown deck, such as a character deck, a location deck, the blessings deck, or any other deck the game tells you to create, draw from the top of the deck. When you draw a card from a faceup pile, such as your discard pile, the blessings discard pile, or any other pile the game tells you to create, draw a card of your choice. When you draw a card from the box, unless you are told to draw a specific card, draw a random card of the appropriate type." Note: This resolution was incorporated into PDF Edition 1.0 of the rulebook.

## The FAQ entry above talks about drawing. What if I'm told to shuffle or bury a card?

The resolution above applies to those things as well.

Resolution: Append the following to the resolution of the previous FAQ: "This applies to actions other than drawing—for example, if you're told to bury 1 card from your deck, bury the top card; if you're told to bury 1 card from your discard pile, you choose the card."

## If I reveal a card for a power, and then something messes with my hand, is the revealed card in my hand? What if I display it? If I discard a card that could be recharged, but something messes with my discard pile before I can make the check to recharge it, is the card really in the discard pile?

Revealing and displaying happen instantly. Every other action waits until you know what action it really is.

Resolution: On page 10 of the rulebook, after the bulleted list of possible actions, add the following: "When you reveal a card, it does not leave your hand. When you display a card, it leaves your hand immediately. When you play a card by performing any other action, set it aside while you process its effects. For example, a spell might tell you to discard it, then allow you to succeed at a check to recharge it instead; set it aside until you resolve the check that determines whether or not you recharge it. While set aside, a card does not count as being in your hand, your discard pile, your deck, or anywhere else."

## Something made a card go back in the box or into a deck even though there were still things on the card that hadn't been done. Do I still do those things?
Yes.

Resolution: On page 10 of the rulebook, following the paragraph that appears after the bulleted list of actions, add the following: "Cards often have instructions that you need to follow after you play the card; follow these instructions even if the card is no longer in your hand (even if the card is out of your sight, such as in the box or in a deck)."

## If a card says I can attempt a check to affect my check to acquire or defeat that card, when do I attempt that check?

Immediately before you start the check to defeat or acquire.

Resolution: On page 10 of the rulebook, in the second paragraph of Encountering a Card, add the sentence "The card you're encountering might require or allow a check that can affect your check to acquire or defeat; you must resolve that check before you begin the check to acquire or defeat."

## If a power allows you to automatically defeat or acquire a card, does it count as succeeding at the check or checks to do so? And when exactly do I use that power?
It does count as succeeding at the required checks, and you use it when you would attempt the check.

Resolution: On page 10 of the rulebook, under Attempt the Check, add the following as a new paragraph after the first paragraph.

If a power allows you to automatically defeat or acquire a card, you may use it instead of attempting the check. Using such a power counts as succeeding at all checks required to defeat or acquire the card. You may not use such a power on any card that does not have a check to acquire or defeat, or on any card that has a check you're not allowed to succeed at.

## If there are multiple faceup cards on top of a single location deck, are you supposed to encounter them all in a single exploration?

One per exploration.

Resolution: On page 11 of the rulebook, in the Faceup Cards sidebar, change the last sentence to the following: "If multiple cards are left faceup on the same deck, you may place them in any order and encounter them in that order, one per exploration." Note: This resolution was incorporated into PDF Edition 1.0 of the rulebook.

## If I'm told to attempt a check, and I don't want to succeed, can I just choose to fail?

No. You don't have to spend resources to succeed, and if you have a choice of skills, you don't have to use your best skill... but you do have to attempt the check.

Resolution: On page 11 of the rulebook, under Attempting a Check, add the following to the end of the first paragraph: "When you are required to attempt a check, you may not choose to fail it."

## When a power adds a skill to a check, does it change the type of check? For example, if I use Padrig to add my Arcane skill to a Strength check, does that make it an Arcane check?

No. When a power says you may use a skill for a check (like most weapons and attack spells), it adds the skills you're using as traits to the check, but when you're just adding another skill to a check, those skills are not added as traits.

Resolution: On page 12 of the rulebook, under "Determine Which Skill You're Using," replace the first two paragraphs with the three that follow. (This might seem like a big change, but mostly, we've taken the opportunity to rewrite and reorganize this section for clarity and to add some more examples. The most significant additions are the last two sentences, and even these are just to clarify that a thing doesn't happen; since nothing ever suggested it did happen, none of this actually changes gameplay at all.)

Determine Which Skill You’re Using. Cards that require a check specify the skill or skills you can use to attempt the check. Each check to defeat or acquire a card lists one or more skills; you may choose any of the listed skills for your check. For example, if a check lists Dexterity, Disable, Strength, and Melee, you may use any one of those skills to attempt your check. Even if your character doesn’t have any of the skills listed for a check, you can still attempt the check, but your die is a d4.

Some cards allow you to use a particular skill for a specific type of check, or to use one skill instead of another. (These cards generally say things like "For your combat check, use your Strength or Melee skill," or "Use your Strength skill instead of your Diplomacy skill.") You may play only 1 such card or use only 1 such power to determine which skill you're using. A few cards that can be used on checks don’t use any of your skills; they instead specify the exact dice you need to roll or the result of your die roll.

The skill you're using for the check, and any skill referenced by that skill, are added as traits to the check. For example, if your character has the skill Melee: Strength +2, and you are using your Melee skill, both the Strength and the Melee traits are added to the check. When you're playing a card to determine the skill you're using, that card’s traits are also added to the check; for example, revealing the weapon Heavy Pick for your combat check adds the Pick, Melee, Piercing, and Basic traits to the check. (This isn’t the same as giving you a skill; for example, playing the spell Dazzle adds the Arcane trait to your check, but it does not give you the Arcane skill.) If a power adds an additional skill to a check, that skill is not added as a trait to the check. For example, a card that adds your Craft skill to your combat check does not add the Craft trait to your check.

## If a power lets me reroll dice, and I have a way to use that power more than once, can I?

Nope. If a different power allows you to reroll, that’s ok, but you can't use the same reroll power more than once.

Resolution: On page 13 of the rulebook, under Attempt the Roll, add the following after the first sentence: "Powers may allow or require you to reroll 1 or more dice; each such power can let you reroll dice only once in a single check or step.” Note: This correction was included in PDF Edition 1.0 of the rulebook.

## If your character dies during an encounter, do you keep doing the steps of your turn? What happens to the card you were encountering?

If your character dies, your turn immediately ends. So this rule tells you what to do with the card you were encountering.

Resolution: On page 14 of the rulebook, under Dying, add the italicized text to the following sentence: "Bury your deck, hand, and discard pile; your turn immediately ends."

## When something affects all characters, or a random character, could it affect a dead character? Can dead characters affect anything?

Dead characters can't affect anything, and things only affect dead characters when they specifically say they do.

Resolution: On page 14 of the rulebook, under Dying, amend the following sentence with the portion in italics: "You cannot take turns, play cards, move, do anything, or affect anything while you are dead; effects that refer to characters do not affect you unless they specifically refer to dead characters.

## When you redeem a card, can you choose any card on the Redemption card?

No—unless a card specifies otherwise, you can only redeem one of your cards. (Page 10 of the rulebook tells you that "your cards include your deck, the cards in your hand, and your buried, discarded, and displayed cards.")

Resolution:

On page 14 of the rulebook, add the italicized text to the following sentence: "When a card allows you to redeem a card, and that card is among your cards, check it off on the redemption card."

On page 23 of the rulebook, add the italicized text to the following sentence: "When a card allows you to redeem one of these cards, and that card is among your cards, check it off on the redemption card."

## When you summon and build a location, do you add henchmen or villains?

Not unless you're instructed to.

Resolution: On page 15 of the rulebook, under Summoning and Adding Cards, add the italicized text to the paragraph below.

If you’re told to summon and build a location, if it’s not already built, retrieve the location card from the box and build the location as usual; do not add villains or henchmen unless instructed to do so. The location and its deck remain in play for the rest of the scenario and are no longer considered summoned cards.

## What does "summon and play" mean?

Resolution: On page 15 of the rulebook, under Summoning and Adding Cards, add the following as a new paragraph following the paragraph about "summon and build."

If you are instructed to summon and play a card, immediately draw the card from the box and play it, using any power on it that can be used in the current circumstance, then banish it. If no power on it can be used in the current circumstance, banish it.

## Can you close a location that your character is not at?

No.

Resolution: Under Closing a Location on page 15, add the following to the end of the first paragraph: "You can never attempt to close a location unless your character is at that location."

posted Jul 14, 2015 | back to top

## If there's a cohort in a location deck when it gets banished, does that mean it gets removed from the game? That seems pretty mean.

We're not that mean.

Resolution: On page 15 of the rulebook, under Closing a Location, make the italicized changes in the following text: "If you succeed at meeting the When Closing requirement, search the location deck for cohorts and encounter them. Then search the deck for villains. If you find any, banish all non-villain cards from the location deck; the location is not closed—but at least you know where the villains are!"

posted Dec 5, 2015 | back to top

## I have some questions about temporarily closing locations.

Excellent—we have some answers. Temp closes need to happen before you encounter the villain, not when you encounter it. The villain's location cannot be temporarily closed. And if something causes you to move to another location before you can make your attempt, bad luck for you.

Resolution: On page 16 of the rulebook, under Attempt to Temporarily Close Open Locations, replace "When a character encounters a villain, each character at any other location may immediately attempt to fulfill the When Closing requirement for his location" with the following:

Before a character encounters a villain, each other character at any other location may immediately attempt to fulfill the When Closing requirement for his location; the villain's location cannot be temporarily closed. You may decide the order in which these attempts are made. If anything causes a character to move to a different location before his attempt is made, he cannot attempt to close a location.

## The "Dealing with Cards" sidebar tells me what to do if I don't have enough cards to perform a required task. What do I do if the task requires some non-card resource, like characters, or mythic charges?

The same rules apply—use as many as you have.

Resolution: Replace the Dealing with Cards sidebar on page 17 with a new sidebar entitled Limited Resources:

If you’re required to do something with a certain number of things and there aren’t that many things available, use as many as there are. For example, if you're told to choose 2 characters at a location occupied by only 1 character, choose only that character. If you’re told to draw 4 cards from a deck that has only 3 cards, draw the 3 cards. (Regardless, if you need to remove any number of cards from the blessings deck and don’t have enough, you lose the scenario; if you need to remove any number of cards from your deck and don’t have enough, your character dies.)

Note that this only applies when you are required to do something. If you have the opportunity to do something that requires a limited resource, and you don't have enough of that resource, you cannot do that thing. For example, if you have the opportunity to close a location whose "When Closing" says "Discard 2 spells," and you have only 1 spell, you cannot close that location.

Note: The original sidebar contained the following text: "Whenever you’re instructed to randomly choose cards, shuffle the cards you’re drawing from and draw from the top." That should be moved to the "Drawing Cards" sidebar on page 9, which should be renamed "Dealing with Cards." (Yes, that's what this sidebar used to be called...)

## What happens if a cohort ends up in a location deck?

If you encounter it, you acquire it.

Resolution: On page 22 of the rulebook, following "...after drawing starting hands, each character may add 1 of the listed cohorts to her hand.", add "If you encounter a cohort in a location deck, you automatically acquire it."

## If I have a power that refers to a blessing named for a deity, can I use it only with that specific blessing?

You can use it with any blessing that has the trait of that deity.

Resolution: On page 24 of the rulebook, under Blessing, add "When a power refers to a blessing of a particular deity, it works with any blessing that has that deity's name as a trait. For example, a power that refers to Blessing of Iomedae also applies to any blessing that has the Iomedae trait."

## Can a bane with a Check to Defeat of "None" or "See Below" be defeated by a power that automatically defeats that type of bane?

Not unless the bane says so.

Resolution: On page 25 of the rulebook, under Check to Defeat, change 'If the check is listed as “None,” the bane cannot be defeated' to 'If the check is listed as “None” or “See Below,” the requirements to defeat the bane may be stated in the bane’s power. If the check is listed as “None” and the power does not state the requirements to defeat the bane, the bane cannot be defeated.' Note: This resolution was incorporated into PDF Edition 1.0 of the rulebook.

## When a bane has a power that triggers when "you" do something, does "you" mean just the person encountering the bane, or anybody doing that thing?

It applies to anybody who does that thing.

Resolution: On page 25 of the rulebook, under Banes, add the following to the end of the Powers section: "If a bane says an effect happens if or when you do a particular thing, it applies to any character who does that thing. If it limits the things you can do, that limit applies to any character who wants to do those things; however, if the limitation is the result of an action such as playing a card or attempting a check, it applies only to the character who took that action."

## The "Based on Wrath of the Righteous" credits look an awful lot like the "Based on Skull & Shackles" credits...

Sigh.

Resolution: On page 30, the "Based on Wrath of the Righteous" credits should read "Wolfgang Baur, Jim Groves, James Jacobs, Richard Pett, Amber E. Scott, Neil Spicer, and Greg A. Vaughan."
