# Card Questions: Wrath of the Righteous Base Set

# The B scenarios in Wrath are really hard! What if I don't want them to be so hard?

No problem. If you'd like an easier run, make these optional changes.

Resolution: Make one or both of these changes only if you're looking for an easier time with Wrath B scenarios.

On the B and C henchman Tangle Trap, add the line "If defeated, you may immediately attempt to close the location this henchman came from."

Move some or all of the following cards from Set B and/or C to Set 1, and change their set indicators to 1: the barrier Arboreal Blight (B & C), the monster Carrion Golem (B & C), and 1 of the Demonic Horde barriers in B and/or the Demonic Horde barrier currently in C. Then move some or all of the following cards from Set 1 to Set B, and change their set indicators to B: the monster Accursed Priest and the barrier Poisoned Spiked Pit Trap.

## Getting Vinst in The Elven Entanglement doesn't help much, since a Tangle Trap won't allow me to close my location when I defeat it. Is that how it's supposed to work?

No. It's supposed to work quite a bit better than that.

Resolution: On the cohort Vinst, change "When you attempt to close a location, return this card to the box to automatically close it" to "When any character defeats a henchman from a location deck, return this card to the box to allow that character to automatically close that location".

## When you expend charges for the Mythic Marshal's power, then succeed at the check, do you choose one other character at your location for each charge you spent, or just one regardless of the number spent?

We care about whether you succeeded at the check, not how many charges you spent. No matter how many changes you expend, only one character gets a charge.

Resolution: On the mythic path Mythic Marshal, change "replace 1 of your highest non-d20 dice with a d20, and if you succeed at the check, choose another character at your location to get a charge" with "replace 1 of your highest non-d20 dice with a d20; if you succeed at the check, choose another character at your location to get a charge".

## Lancer Alain can get a ridiculous amount of explorations going with a card that has the Mount trait in his hand. Or discard pile. Or on his deck. This seems abusable.

That's because it is.

Resolution: On the Lancer side of Alain's role card, in the first power, change "Recharge a card" to "Recharge a weapon or an armor".

## Harsk the Demonslayer has a power that gives him a free exploration if he defeats a Demon on his first exploration. Is that the first exploration of the scenario, or of the turn?

The turn.

Resolution: On the Demonslayer side of Harsk's role card, change "On your first exploration" to "On the first exploration of your turn".

## Imrijka's Cold Iron Warden role has a power that works on Blessings of Pharasma, but there are no Blessings of Pharasma in Wrath of the Righteous.

That's a problem.

Resolution: On the Cold Iron Warden side of Imrijka's role card, replace "Blessing of Pharasma" with "blessing that has the Basic trait."

## Wandering Judge Imrijka sure can shuffle a lot of discarded Blessing of Ascension cards into the blessings deck.

No, she can't.

Resolution: On the Wandering Judge side of Imrijka's role card, change "When you play a blessing that matches the top card of the blessings discard pile, you may shuffle the top card of the blessings discard pile into the blessings deck" to "When you play a non-Basic blessing that matches the top card of the blessings discard pile, you may shuffle the top card of the blessings discard pile into the blessings deck".

## Ulkreth has me attempting a Knowledge check while I am already making a check to defeat. Do you really want that?

Noâ€”that Knowledge check needs to happen earlier.

Resolution: On the henchman Ulkreth, change "If the check to defeat has the Acid, Cold, or Fire trait, succeed at a Knowledge 8 check to add 5 to it" to "If you succeed at a Knowledge 8 check, or if your check has the Acid, Cold, or Fire trait, add 5 to your check to defeat". Also, make sure you read this FAQ entry. (Note: This card also appears in the Character Add-On Deck.)

## Arboreal Blight and Corrupted Crusaders are defeated or undefeated based on the result of an encounter with a summoned henchman. What happens if I evade that summoned henchman?

These cards really care about whether or not you defeated that henchman. If you evaded it, you didn't defeat it, so the first card is undefeated.

Resolution: On the barriers Arboreal Blight and Corrupted Crusaders, replace "The barrier is defeated or undefeated based solely on your encounter" with "The barrier is defeated only if you defeat your henchman; otherwise, it is undefeated". (Note: These cards also appear in the Character Add-On Deck.)

## Glibness was Elite in every other set, but it's Basic here. Which should it be?

While we were making Wrath of the Righteous, we came up with the policy that cards with the same power but different traits are not the same card. For example, we wanted to bring back the card Wisdom in this set, but since we wanted characters to be able to use it in their starting decks, we needed it to be Basic instead of Elite, so we instead introduced the card Sagacity, which is identical to Wisdom in every way other than art, name, and the presence of the Basic trait. We failed to apply that rule to Glibness. What we should have done is given it new art and called it "Eloquence."

Resolution: The spell Eloquence will appear in the Oracle Class Deck in December 2015, and we'll include it in the print-on-demand errata deck for Wrath when we create it. If you have Eloquence, you can replace the spell Glibness in the Base Set and the Character Add-On Deck with Eloquence and treat the starting deck lists in the rulebook as if they say Eloquence instead of Glibness. When not using Eloquence, just treat Glibness as having the Basic trait, just as printed, for Wrath of the Righteous only. If you use it in any other set, treat it as having the Elite trait instead.

## When I discard Portable Altar, how long does the 1d6 on my Divine checks last?

Just for that check.

## Can Ring of Climbing be used every time I shuffle a location deck?

Not quite. It can only be used once per check or step.

## Can I use Riding Horse to move when there's nobody else at my location? If there are other characters at my location, do I have to move 1 of them?

You do not have to move another character when you move.

Resolution: On the ally Riding Horse, change the first power to "At the end of your turn, discard this card to move; you may also move another character at your location to your new location."
