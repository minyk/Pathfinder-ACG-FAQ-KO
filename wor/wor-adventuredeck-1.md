## In The Wardstone Legacy, if I play a non-Corrupted blessing, but no Corrupted blessings are left in the box, do I still banish it?

No.

Resolution: On the scenario The Wardstone Legacy, replace "When you play any other blessing and it does not have the Corrupted trait, banish it and replace it with a random blessing that has the Corrupted trait from the box" with "After you play any other blessing, if it does not have the Corrupted trait, exchange it with a random blessing that has the Corrupted trait from the box". (With this wording, if there are no random blessings that have the Corrupted trait left in the box, the instruction becomes impossible, so the Golden Rule tells you to ignore it.)
