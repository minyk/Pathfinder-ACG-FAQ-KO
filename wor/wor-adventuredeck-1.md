## 룰북의 `Under the Broken City` 시나리오 예제는 `Millorn`을 빌런으로 사용하도록 되어 있지만 시나리오 카드에는 `Thurl and Inhaz`로 되어 있습니다. 뭘 써야 하나요(The Example of Play in the printed rulebook suggests Millorn is the villain for the scenario Under the Broken City, but the card says it's Thurl and Inhaz. Who is the villain)?

`Millorn` 입니다.

> Millorn.

> Resolution: On the scenario Under the Broken City, change the villain from "Thurl and Inhaz" to "Millorn".

## `Wardstone Legacy` 시나리오에서 `Corrupted`가 아닌 블레싱을 사용했는데, 박스에 `Corrupted` 블레싱이 없어도 사용한 블레싱을 제거해야 하나요(In The Wardstone Legacy, if I play a non-Corrupted blessing, but no Corrupted blessings are left in the box, do I still banish it)?

아니오.

> No.

> Resolution: On the scenario The Wardstone Legacy, replace "When you play any other blessing and it does not have the Corrupted trait, banish it and replace it with a random blessing that has the Corrupted trait from the box" with "After you play any other blessing, if it does not have the Corrupted trait, exchange it with a random blessing that has the Corrupted trait from the box". (With this wording, if there are no random blessings that have the Corrupted trait left in the box, the instruction becomes impossible, so the Golden Rule tells you to ignore it.)

예

> Yes.

> Resolution: On the location Collapsing Bridge, change the At This Location text to "At the end of your turn, roll 1d10; if you roll higher than the number of cards in this deck, search it for boons and banish them all."

> No, just the ones at the barrier's location.

> Resolution: On the barrier Poison Spiked Pit Trap, change the last power to "If undefeated, each character at this location is dealt 1d4 Combat damage, then 1d4 Poison damage, then end your turn."
