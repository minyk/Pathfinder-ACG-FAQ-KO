# 카드 질문: 아일랜드 오브 엠티 아이즈(어드벤처 덱 4)(Card Questions: Island of Empty Eyes (Skull & Shackles Adventure Deck 4))

## 시나리오를 `Bikendi Otongu`과 함께 이기면, `loot`를 제외한 모든 `boon`을 한 장씩 뽑을 수 있습니다. 카드를 선택할 수 있나요? 카드는 박스에서 나오나요? 시나리오를 반복하면 보상을 또 받을 수 있나요(If I win the scenario with Bikendi Otongu, I get to draw 1 card of each type of boon other than loot. Do I get to choose the cards? Do they come from the box? And can I do it all again when I replay the scenario)?

아니오, 예, 아니오(카드를 선택할 수 없고, 카드는 박스에서 뽑으며, 시나리오를 반복해도 보상을 받을 수 없습니다: 역자주).

> No, yes, and no.

> Resolution: On the role card Bikendi Otongu, change "If you win the scenario, draw 1 card of each boon type other than loot" to "If you win the scenario, draw 1 random card of each type of boon other than loot from the box. This counts as a scenario reward."

## `Home Sweet Home` 시나리오는 `Gholdako` 과 `Ghol-Gon Obelisk` 헨치맨을 사용합니다. 그런데 박스에는 `Gholdako`는 6장이 있지만, `Ghol-Gon Obelisk`는 1장 밖에 없습니다(The Home Sweet Home scenario calls for the henchmen Gholdako and Ghol-Gon Obelisks. Deck 4 contains 6 Gholdakos, but only one Obelisk).

프린트 에러로 인해서 `Island of Empty Eyes` 덱에 6장의 `Gholdako` 와 1장의 `Ghol-Gon Obelisk` 가 들어갔습니다; 실제로는 1장의 `Gholdako` 와 6장의 `Ghol-Gon Obelisk` 가 필요합니다. 그리고  이 문제를 해결하기 위해서 

Due to a printer error, adventure deck 4 of Skull & Shackles, Island of Empty Eyes, included 6 copies of the henchman Gholdako and 1 copy of the henchman Ghol-Gan Obelisk; it should have had 6 Ghol-Gan Obelisks and 1 Gholdako. And due to our own error, it has 1 fewer Blink Spider than you’ll need when you have 6 players.

We have solved this problem by making a pack of cards that includes 5 Ghol-Gan Obelisks, 1 Blink Spider, and—in the interest of turning lemons into lemonade—The Land of the Blind, a brand-new scenario that makes use of those extra Gholdako cards. We provided that for free to customers who purchased Island of Empty Eyes from paizo.com, we sent copies through our distributors, and we inserted the pack into our remaining stock of the Island of Empty Eyes Adventure Deck.

If you need to play the scenario "Home Sweet Home" without access to that pack, we suggest proxying with Buccaneers (that is, setting the Ghol-Gan Obelisk to the side, adding Buccaneers to the location decks instead, and referring to the Obelisk whenever you find a Buccaneer).

## When does the Teleportation Chamber teleport characters?

At the start of your turn.

## If I'm at the Teleportation Chamber, and I fail to defeat the bane that I examined, what happens to it? Or what if I do defeat it, and it's a henchman—can I close the location it came from? Or what if it's the villain—do I...

Hold on there, friend! You're not encountering the card. You're just using its checks to defeat as the checks to close the Teleportation Chamber—nothing more.

Resolution: On the location Teleportation Chamber, change the "When Closing" power to "Examine the top card of a random other open location deck and, if it is a bane, succeed at its checks to defeat. If you did not examine a bane, this location closes automatically."

## On Gargoyle Sniper, you have to succeed at a Perception check to avoid the negative effect. But a similar effect on a couple of cards in Adventure Deck 6 can be bypassed with a Wisdom or Perception check. Should this match those?

Yes.

Resolution: On the monster Gargoyle Sniper, change "succeed at a Perception 12 check" to "succeed at a Wisdom or Perception 12 check".

## Conch of the Tritons says other cards can't be used on the check. What about character powers?

Nope.

Resolution: On the loot Conch of the Tritons, change "No other cards may be used on this check" to "Characters may not play other cards or use powers on this check".
