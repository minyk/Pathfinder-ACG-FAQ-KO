## Shrine to Besmara says "Your checks have the Pirate or Swashbuckling trait." If my check already has one, can I still choose the other? Can I choose both? How about neither?

Besmara just wants to help you. Pick the ones you like.

Resolution: On the location Shrine to Besmara, change the "At this location" text to "You may add the Pirate and/or Swashbuckling traits to your checks."

## When I encounter a Chelish Marine, am I supposed to summon another one for myself?

## Can the Adamantine Trident +3 ignore difficulty-increasing powers for any monster encountered by anyone?

No, just monsters you encounter. This power is intended to be part of the power above it, affecting only monsters against which you are currently attempting a check to defeat.

Resolution: On the weapon Adamantine Trident +3, change "If a monster has a power that increases the difficulty of a combat check" to "If a monster has a power that increases the difficulty of that combat check", and move that sentence to the end of the first power.

## Doubleshot Pepperbox says that if I didn't bury it, but I did bury cards to add damage, I might be able to shuffle it into my deck. How do I bury cards to add damage without also burying the Doubleshot Pepperbox?

You can't, so that condition will never happen.

Resolution: On the weapon Doubleshot Pepperbox, delete the phrase "or on a 1–4 if you buried any cards to add damage".
