# 카드 질문: 스컬 \& 새클스 캐릭터 애드온 덱(Card Questions: Skull & Shackles Character Add-On Deck)

## `Damiel`이 실제로 사용하지 않았지만 배니쉬되는 `Alchemical`카드를 리차지 할 수 있나요? 그런 카드들을 *반드시* 리차지해야 하나요(Can Damiel recharge Alchemical cards that he banishes even when he doesn't actually play those cards? And does he *have* to recharge them)?

아니오.

> No and no.

> Resolution: In the Powers section on Damiel's character card and both sides of his role card, change "When you would banish a card that has the Alchemical trait, recharge it instead" to "When you play a card that has the Alchemical trait and would banish it, you may recharge it instead".

## Lini's Aquamancer role has a power that apparently helps combat checks against ships, but ships never have combat checks. What's the deal there?

The power should help characters with any check against a ship, not just combat checks.

Resolution: On the Aquamancer side of Lini's role card, replace the second-to-last power with the following:

□ Add 2 (□ 4) to any combat check by a character at your location against a card that has the Aquatic trait (□ or any check by that character against a ship).

## Lini's Aquamancer role has a power that lets her put an Aquatic monster she defeated into her hand. Does that apply to escaping villains, too?

No, only to monsters that would otherwise be banished.

Resolution: On the Aquamancer side of Lini's role card, after "If you defeat a monster that has the Aquatic trait" add "and would banish it".
