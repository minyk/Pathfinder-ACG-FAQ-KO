# 카드 질문: 스컬 \& 새클스 캐릭터 애드온 덱(Card Questions: Skull & Shackles Character Add-On Deck)

## `Damiel`이 실제로 사용하지 않았지만 배니쉬되는 `Alchemical`카드를 재충전 할 수 있나요? 그런 카드들을 *반드시* 재충전 해야 하나요(Can Damiel recharge Alchemical cards that he banishes even when he doesn't actually play those cards? And does he *have* to recharge them)?

아니오.

> No and no.

> Resolution: In the Powers section on Damiel's character card and both sides of his role card, change "When you would banish a card that has the Alchemical trait, recharge it instead" to "When you play a card that has the Alchemical trait and would banish it, you may recharge it instead".

## `Damiel the Chirurgeon`이 자신의 턴이 아닐 때 손패의 수를 늘리면, 자신의 턴 끝까지 유지가 되나요 혹은 그냥 그 턴에만 유지가 되나요(When Damiel the Chirurgeon increases his hand size and it's not his turn, does that last until the end of his turn, or just the end of that turn)?

그냥 그 턴이 끝날 때까지만 유지됩니다.

> Just until the end of that turn.

> Resolution: On the Chirurgeon side of Damiel's role card, change the last power to "When you reset your hand, you may discard any number of cards; your hand size is increased by that number until the end of the turn."

## `Lini`의 `Aquamancer` 역할은 배를 상대로 전투 체크를 할 때 도움이 되는 파워를 가지고 있지만, 배는 전투 체크가 없습니다. 어떻게 된 것인가요(Lini's Aquamancer role has a power that apparently helps combat checks against ships, but ships never have combat checks. What's the deal there)?

그 파워는 전투 체크만이 아니라 배를 대상으로 하는 모든 체크에 도움을 줄 수 있습니다.

> The power should help characters with any check against a ship, not just combat checks.

> Resolution: On the Aquamancer side of Lini's role card, replace the second-to-last power with the following:

> □ Add 2 (□ 4) to any combat check by a character at your location against a card that has the Aquatic trait (□ or any check by that character against a ship).

## `Lini`의 `Aquamancer` 역할은 물리친 `Aquatic` 몬스터를 본패에 넣을 수 있는 파워가 있습니다. 이 능력이 도망가는 `Villain`에게도 적용이 되나요(Lini's Aquamancer role has a power that lets her put an Aquatic monster she defeated into her hand. Does that apply to escaping villains, too)?

아니오, 제거되는 몬스터에만 적용됩니다.

> No, only to monsters that would otherwise be banished.

> Resolution: On the Aquamancer side of Lini's role card, after "If you defeat a monster that has the Aquatic trait" add "and would banish it".
