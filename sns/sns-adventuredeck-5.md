# 카드 질문: 더 프린스 오브 인퍼미(어드벤처 덱 5)(Card Questions: The Price of Infamy (Skull & Shackles Adventure Deck 5))

## If you're playing Best Served Cold with 6 players, there aren't enough Erinyes Devils in the box to fill out all the locations.

Yep—that's a problem.

Resolution: On the scenario Best Served Cold, in the list of henchman, add "Sentinel Devil" before Erinyes Devils.

## When you resolve an encounter with a summoned card, it's always supposed to go back in the box. In Best Served Cold, are you really supposed to put the cards you summon from the henchman pile back in the box after the encounter?

Nope—they go back into the pile.

Resolution: In the scenario Best Served Cold's During This Scenario section, change "When you encounter Barnabas Harrigan, each other character must summon and encounter a random henchman from the henchman pile" to "When you encounter Barnabas Harrigan, each other character must encounter a random henchman from the henchman pile. Return the henchman to the pile after the encounter."

## When you resolve an encounter with a summoned card, it's always supposed to go back in the box unless the card that summons it tells you otherwise. But Gilbrok the Tongue summons a henchman that seems like it’s supposed to stick around if undefeated, but Gilbrok doesn't actually tell you otherwise. What happens?

The summoned henchman gets displayed.

Resolution: On the henchman Gilbrok the Tongue, add the following to the end of the second power: “If the summoned henchman is undefeated, display it next to your character card.”

## When the Voidstick Zombie increases the difficulty of Divine checks at your location, does that include the Divine check to defeat the Voidstick Zombie itself? And what happens if you change locations before the end of the turn?

The power should kick in only after your check to defeat the Zombie, and if you move, the effect stays with the location you were at.

Resolution: On the monster Voidstick Zombie, replace the power "For the rest of the turn, the difficulty of Divine checks at your location is increased by 3, and powers that have the Healing trait used by characters at your location recharge 1 fewer card" with "After your check to defeat, until the end of the turn, the difficulty of Divine checks by characters at your current location is increased by 3, and powers that have the Healing trait used by those characters recharge 1 fewer card".

## Except for Keen Rapier +3, rapiers and other keen weapons all have penalties when used by characters who aren’t proficient with weapons. Should Keen Rapier +3 have that penalty?

Yes.

Resolution: On the weapon Keen Rapier +3, add the sentence “If you aren’t proficient with weapons, the difficulty of this check is increased by 4.”
