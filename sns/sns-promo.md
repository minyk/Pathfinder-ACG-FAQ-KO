# 카드 질문: 프로모션 카드(Card Questions: Promo Cards)

## The Goblin Weidling is a Class 0 ship, so it can be part of my fleet during Plunder & Peril. But it requires you to summon and encounter the henchman Riptide Grindylow, which is in Adventure Deck 1. What should I do?

Go ahead and fetch the Riptide Grindylow from the Adventure Deck 1 box!

## If I defeat the summoned Riptide Grindylow, does the difficulty of one check against the Owlbeartross go up by 4, or does it affect both checks? Please say just one.

It's both, I'm afraid.

Resolution: On the monster Owlbeartross, change "If that henchman is defeated, the difficulty of the check to defeat the Owlbeartross is increased by 4" to "If that henchman is defeated, the difficulty of checks to defeat the Owlbeartross is increased by 4".

Due to a printer error, adventure deck 4 of Skull & Shackles, Island of Empty Eyes, included 6 copies of the henchman Gholdako and 1 copy of the henchman Ghol-Gan Obelisk; it should have had 6 Ghol-Gan Obelisks and 1 Gholdako. And due to our own error, it has 1 fewer Blink Spider than you’ll need when you have 6 players. We solved this problem by making a pack of cards that includes 5 Ghol-Gan Obelisks, 1 Blink Spider, and—in the interest of turning lemons into lemonade—The Land of the Blind, a brand-new promo scenario that makes use of those extra Gholdako cards. We provided that pack for free to customers who purchased Island of Empty Eyes from paizo.com, sent copies through our distributors, and inserted it into our remaining stock of the Island of Empty Eyes Adventure Deck. (The cards in this pack are not usable without the Island of Empty Eyes Adventure Deck, and only one pack is needed per adventure deck.)
