You may recharge a card to add 1d6 (▢+1) to your combat check for each displayed monster." to "When you defeat a monster and would banish it, you may display it instead.

# Wizard Class Deck

## It seems like it might be possible to abuse Radillo's power to examine her deck after playing an Arcane spell, such as creating an endless loop of Detect Magics.

That doesn't sound fun.

Resolution: On Radillo's character card and both sides of her role card, change "After you play a spell that has the Arcane trait" to "When you play a spell that has the Arcane trait during an encounter".

posted Oct 10, 2014 | back to top

## When you resolve an encounter with a summoned card, it's always supposed to go back in the box. But Radillo's Arcane Collector role has a power that seems like it's supposed to let you keep a summoned card in your hand. Does it?

You can keep the card if you succeed at the check to acquire it.

Resolution: On the Arcane Collector side of Radillo's role card, replace "When you encounter a boon, you may bury a card to banish it and instead summon and encounter a random boon of the same type ... from the box" with "When you encounter a boon, you may bury a card to exchange it with a random boon of the same type ... from the box".

## If I run into a monster with two checks to defeat, and Radillo the Puppet Master is at my location, does her power allow me to reduce the difficulty of both checks by recharging a single ally?

No. Recharging one ally reduces the difficulty of one check.

Resolution: On the Puppet Master side of Radillo's role card, change "When any character at your location encounters a monster, you may recharge an ally to reduce the difficulty of the check to defeat the monster" to "When any character at your location attempts a check to defeat a monster, you may recharge an ally to reduce the difficulty of that check".

## If I make a combat check using Sphere of Fire, can I play another spell? If I don't have the Arcane or Divine skill, can I discard Sphere of Fire for its additional damage and thus avoid having to banish the card?

No and no. Using the power of Sphere of Fire counts as a spell. And if you discard the spell, it triggers the last part of the power.

Resolution: On the spell Sphere of Fire, replace "At the end of your turn, if you do not have either the Arcane or Divine skill..." with "This counts as playing a spell. At the end of your turn, or when you would discard this card when playing it, if you do not have either the Arcane or Divine skill..."
