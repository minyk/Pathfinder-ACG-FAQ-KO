# 로그 클래스 덱(Rogue Class Deck)

## `Lesath`가 자신의 턴 끝에 표시된 몬스터를 제거하면 다시 표시해야 하나요(If Lesath banishes a displayed monster at the end of his turn, does he then have to display it again)?

아니오, 그러면 몬스터들이 제거되지 않습니다. 그런 것은 아닙니다.

> No, because then they would never get banished. That's no good.

> Resolution: On Lesath's character card and the Sword Dancer side of his role card, change "When you would banish a monster, display it. You may recharge a card to add 1d6 (▢+1) to your combat check for each displayed monster." to "When you defeat a monster and would banish it, you may display it instead. Before you attempt a combat check, you may recharge a card to add a number of d6 (▢+1) equal to your number of displayed monsters. At the end of your turn, banish your displayed monsters."

> On the Dervish side of his role card, change the power to "When you defeat a monster and would banish it, you may display it instead. Before you attempt a combat check, you may recharge a card to add a number of d6 (▢+1) (▢+2) (▢+3) equal to your number of displayed monsters. At the end of your turn, banish your displayed monsters."

## `Merisiel the Forger`는 버린 무기 카드들에 영향을 주는 파워가 있습니다. 플레이한 무기로만 제한되나요(Merisiel the Forger has a power that affects weapons she discards. Is that restricted to weapons that she plays)?

플레이한 카드로만 제한되어야 합니다.

> It should be restricted to cards you play.

> Resolution: On the Forger side of Merisiel's role card, make the changes in italics to the following power: "When you play a weapon and would discard (□ or bury) (□ or banish) it, you may perform the action with a blessing (□ or any card) instead."

## 복수의 체크가 필요한 몬스터를 인카운터하였을 때 `Olenjack`은 그 체크들간 탐험을 할 수 있나요(When encountering a monster that has multiple checks to defeat, can Olenjack explore in between those checks)?

아니오.

> No.

> Resolution: On Olenjack's character card and both sides of his role card, change "On your turn, when you succeed at a combat check that has the Poison trait, you may immediately explore again" to "On your turn, when you succeed at a combat check that has the Poison trait, after defeating the bane you may immediately explore again".

## `Wu Shen`의 `Prey Stalker` 역할을 선택하면 즉시 배리어를 물리치는 체크에 2를 더하는 파워를 얻게되나요(Do I gain the power to add 2 to my checks to defeat barriers as soon as I select Wu Shen's Prey Stalker role)?

아니오, 그 파워의 앞에는 체크박스가 있어야 합니다. 하지만 이미 너무 많은 피트가 있으므로, 그 파워의 마지막에 있는 체크박스를 제거합니다.

> No, that power should have a checkbox at the front. But then she'll have too many feats, so we need to remove the last checkbox in that power.

> Resolution: On the Prey Stalker side of Wu Shen's role card, change "Add 2 (▢ 4) to your check to defeat a barrier (▢ or close a location)" to "▢ Add 2 (▢ 4) to your check to defeat a barrier or close a location".

## `Keen Rapier +3`를 제외하면 모든 레이피어나 keen 무기는 사용 캐릭터가 무기에 대한 특화 능력이 없으면 패널티를 가지고 있습니다. `Keen Rapier +3`도 이런 패널티가 있어야 하지 않나요(Except for Keen Rapier +3, rapiers and other keen weapons all have penalties when used by characters who aren’t proficient with weapons. Should Keen Rapier +3 have that penalty)?

예.

> Yes.

> Resolution: On the weapon Keen Rapier +3, add the sentence “If you aren’t proficient with weapons, the difficulty of this check is increased by 4.”

## 로그 클래스 덱에 있는 `Light Crossbow +1`에는 `Magic` 특성 대신 `Basic` 특성이 있습니다. 잘못된 것인가요(The Light Crossbow +1 in the Rogue Class Deck has the Basic trait instead of the Magic trait. That's wrong, right)?

예, 잘못되었습니다.

> Right—that's wrong.

> Resolution: On the weapon Light Crossbow +1, replace the Basic trait with the Magic trait. (This card is correct in the Wizard Class Deck.)

## `Main-Gauche +1`을 다른 무기와 함께 사용할 수 있나요? 파워의 첫 문장은 사용할 수 있는 경우가 아니라 못하는 경우를 말하네요(Can I play Main-Gauche +1 with another weapon or not? The first sentence tells me when I can't, not when I can).

`2-Handed` 특성이 없는 무기를 플레이하면 사용할 수 있습니다.

> You can, so long as you didn't play another weapon with the 2-Handed trait.

> Resolution: On the weapon Main-Gauche +1, replace the text with the following:

>> For your combat check, reveal this card to use your Strength or Melee skill + 1d4+1.

>> Recharge this card to reduce Combat damage dealt to you by 2. You may play this card on a check even if you played a weapon that does not have the 2-Handed trait.

## 다른 `Speed` 주문은 `Wisdom` 혹은 `Divine` 체크로 얻을 수 있는데, 로그 덱의 `Speed`는 그렇지 않습니다. 어떻게 해야 되나요(Other versions of Speed can be acquired with Wisdom or Divine, but not the one in the Rogue deck. What's the deal)?

참 신기한 오류입니다.

> That's a pretty mysterious error.

> Resolution: On the spell Speed, the check to acquire should be Intelligence Arcane Wisdom Divine 6.

## `Arrow Catching Studded Leather`는 `Magic` 특성이 있습니다. 이 카드들은 손패를 리셋하는 과정에서 재충전할 수 있어야 하지 않나요(The Arrow Catching Studded Leather has the Magic trait. Shouldn’t it let you recharge it when you reset your hand)?

예.

> Yes.

> Resolution: On the armor Arrow Catching Studded Leather, add the following text: “If you are proficient with light armors, you may recharge this card when you reset your hand.”

## `Burglar`를 회피하면 무기나 아이템을 버려야 하나요? 얻지 않기로 결정하면 어떻게 되나요(If I evade the Burglar, do I have to discard a weapon or item? What if I choose not to acquire it)?

`Burglar`를 회피하면 카드를 버릴 필요가 없습니다. 카드를 회피하면 카드에 있는 파워 중 어떤 것도 발동되지 않습니다. `Burglar`를 얻지 않기로 결정한 경우에는 카드를 버려야만 합니다.

> If you evade the Burglar, you don't have to discard, because the Skull & Shackles rulebook clarified that if you evade a card, you do not activate any other powers on it. If you choose not to acquire the Burglar, you do have to discard.

> Resolution: On the ally Burglar, change "If you fail the check to acquire this card" to "If you fail to acquire this card". (The Skull & Shackles rulebook introduced the rule "If you choose not to acquire a boon, it counts as failing to acquire it.")
