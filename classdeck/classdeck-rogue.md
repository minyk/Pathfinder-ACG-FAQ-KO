# Rogue Class Deck

## If Lesath banishes a displayed monster at the end of his turn, does he then have to display it again?

No, because then they would never get banished. That's no good.

Resolution: On Lesath's character card and the Sword Dancer side of his role card, change "When you would banish a monster, display it. You may recharge a card to add 1d6 (▢+1) to your combat check for each displayed monster." to "When you defeat a monster and would banish it, you may display it instead. Before you attempt a combat check, you may recharge a card to add a number of d6 (▢+1) equal to your number of displayed monsters. At the end of your turn, banish your displayed monsters."

On the Dervish side of his role card, change the power to "When you defeat a monster and would banish it, you may display it instead. Before you attempt a combat check, you may recharge a card to add a number of d6 (▢+1) (▢+2) (▢+3) equal to your number of displayed monsters. At the end of your turn, banish your displayed monsters."

## When encountering a monster that has multiple checks to defeat, can Olenjack explore in between those checks?

No.

Resolution: On Olenjack's character card and both sides of his role card, change "On your turn, when you succeed at a combat check that has the Poison trait, you may immediately explore again" to "On your turn, when you succeed at a combat check that has the Poison trait, after defeating the bane you may immediately explore again".

## Do I gain the power to add 2 to my checks to defeat barriers as soon as I select Wu Shen's Prey Stalker role?

No, that power should have a checkbox at the front. But then she'll have too many feats, so we need to remove the last checkbox in that power.

Resolution: On the Prey Stalker side of Wu Shen's role card, change "Add 2 (▢ 4) to your check to defeat a barrier (▢ or close a location)" to "▢ Add 2 (▢ 4) to your check to defeat a barrier or close a location".

## Except for Keen Rapier +3, rapiers and other keen weapons all have penalties when used by characters who aren’t proficient with weapons. Should Keen Rapier +3 have that penalty?

Yes.

Resolution: On the weapon Keen Rapier +3, add the sentence “If you aren’t proficient with weapons, the difficulty of this check is increased by 4.”

## The Light Crossbow +1 in the Rogue Class Deck has the Basic trait instead of the Magic trait. That's wrong, right?

Right—that's wrong.

Resolution: On the weapon Light Crossbow +1, replace the Basic trait with the Magic trait. (This card is correct in the Wizard Class Deck.)

## Can I play Main-Gauche +1 with another weapon or not? The first sentence tells me when I can't, not when I can.

You can, so long as you didn't play another weapon with the 2-Handed trait.

Resolution: On the weapon Main-Gauche +1, replace the text with the following:

For your combat check, reveal this card to use your Strength or Melee skill + 1d4+1.

Recharge this card to reduce Combat damage dealt to you by 2. You may play this card on a check even if you played a weapon that does not have the 2-Handed trait.

## Other versions of Speed can be acquired with Wisdom or Divine, but not the one in the Rogue deck. What's the deal?

That's a pretty mysterious error.

Resolution: On the spell Speed, the check to acquire should be Intelligence Arcane Wisdom Divine 6.

## The Arrow Catching Studded Leather has the Magic trait. Shouldn’t it let you recharge it when you reset your hand?

Yes.

Resolution: On the armor Arrow Catching Studded Leather, add the following text: “If you are proficient with light armors, you may recharge this card when you reset your hand.”
