# Wizard Class Deck

## It seems like it might be possible to abuse Radillo's power to examine her deck after playing an Arcane spell, such as creating an endless loop of Detect Magics.

That doesn't sound fun.

Resolution: On Radillo's character card and both sides of her role card, change "After you play a spell that has the Arcane trait" to "When you play a spell that has the Arcane trait during an encounter".

## When you resolve an encounter with a summoned card, it's always supposed to go back in the box. But Radillo's Arcane Collector role has a power that seems like it's supposed to let you keep a summoned card in your hand. Does it?

You can keep the card if you succeed at the check to acquire it.

Resolution: On the Arcane Collector side of Radillo's role card, replace "When you encounter a boon, you may bury a card to banish it and instead summon and encounter a random boon of the same type ... from the box" with "When you encounter a boon, you may bury a card to exchange it with a random boon of the same type ... from the box".

## If I run into a monster with two checks to defeat, and Radillo the Puppet Master is at my location, does her power allow me to reduce the difficulty of both checks by recharging a single ally?

No. Recharging one ally reduces the difficulty of one check.

Resolution: On the Puppet Master side of Radillo's role card, change "When any character at your location encounters a monster, you may recharge an ally to reduce the difficulty of the check to defeat the monster" to "When any character at your location attempts a check to defeat a monster, you may recharge an ally to reduce the difficulty of that check".

## The Snake card in the Wizard Class Deck says it adds to "your non-combat Stealth check," but the Snake in the Rise of the Runelords Character Add-On Deck says it adds to "your Stealth check." Which is correct?

The Rise of the Runelords version is correct.

Resolution: On the ally Snake, remove the word "non-combat."

## Why would I discard the Sling instead of revealing it?

"Instead" should be "additionally". Throwing it is better than swinging it.

Resolution: On the weapon Sling, change "instead" to "additionally".

## If I don't have the Arcane or Divine skill, can I really just discard the spell Masterwork when I play it? I'm used to banishing spells like that.

You need to banish it.

Resolution: On the spell Masterwork, add the italicized portion to the following text: "At the start of your turn, if you do not have either the Arcane or Divine skill, banish this card; otherwise, attempt an Arcane or Divine 12 check. If you succeed, recharge this card; if you fail, discard it."

## If I make a combat check using Sphere of Fire, can I play another spell? If I don't have the Arcane or Divine skill, can I discard Sphere of Fire for its additional damage and thus avoid having to banish the card?

No and no. Using the power of Sphere of Fire counts as a spell. And if you discard the spell, it triggers the last part of the power.

Resolution: On the spell Sphere of Fire, replace "At the end of your turn, if you do not have either the Arcane or Divine skill..." with "This counts as playing a spell. At the end of your turn, or when you would discard this card when playing it, if you do not have either the Arcane or Divine skill..."

## Should you really be able to acquire the Incanter with the Divine trait?

No.

Resolution: On the ally Incanter, remove Divine from the check to acquire.
