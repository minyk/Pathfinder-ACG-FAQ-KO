## Adamantine Sai +2 says I can ignore a monster's effects that increase the difficulty of a combat check. Does that include, for example, the difficulty increase from a monster with the Veteran trait, even though that power doesn't specifically say it affects combat checks?

Yes. We want you to ignore any effects from monsters that would make your combat check more difficult.

Resolution: On the weapon Adamantine Sai +2, replace "If a monster has an effect that increases the difficulty of a combat check, ignore that effect" with "If a monster has an effect that increases the difficulty of that check, ignore that effect".
