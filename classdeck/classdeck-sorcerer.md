## Since “before I reset my hand” is not part of a step, can I use Amaryllis’s spell recharge power as many times as I want?

No—just once. We’ll limit it to “at the end of your turn” so it happens during a step.

Resolution: On Amaryllis's character card and both sides of her role card, change "After (▢ and before) you reset your hand" to "At the end of your turn, after (▢ and before) you reset your hand".

## Can Amaryllis use her role powers that depend on Blessing of the Gods in a set without any such blessings?

Yes. Let's open that up to all Basic blessings.

## If I check the box that lets Seoni the Tattooed Mystic draw 2 cards after being dealt damage, can I still draw only 1?

Yes.

Resolution: On the Tattooed Mystic side of Seoni's role card, change "After you are dealt Acid, Cold, Electricity, or Fire damage, you may draw 1 card (▢ 2 cards)" to "After you are dealt Acid, Cold, Electricity, or Fire damage, you may draw 1 card (▢ or 2 cards)".

## Can I play Main-Gauche +1 with another weapon or not? The first sentence tells me when I can't, not when I can.

You can, so long as you didn't play another weapon with the 2-Handed trait.

Resolution: On the weapon Main-Gauche +1, replace the text with the following:

For your combat check, reveal this card to use your Strength or Melee skill + 1d4+1.

Recharge this card to reduce Combat damage dealt to you by 2. You may play this card on a check even if you played a weapon that does not have the 2-Handed trait.

## Why would I discard the Sling instead of revealing it?

"Instead" should be "additionally". Throwing it is better than swinging it.

Resolution: On the weapon Sling, change "instead" to "additionally".
