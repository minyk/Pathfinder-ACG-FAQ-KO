## If a character at Siwar the Courtier's location fails to acquire an ally, can Siwar put it in her discard pile?

A bit.

(▢ Characters gain this power while at your location.)"

## If I evade the Burglar, do I have to discard a weapon or item? What if I choose not to acquire it?

If you evade the Burglar, you don't have to discard, because the Skull & Shackles rulebook clarified that if you evade a card, you do not activate any other powers on it. If you choose not to acquire the Burglar, you do have to discard.

Resolution: On the ally Burglar, change "If you fail the check to acquire this card" to "If you fail to acquire this card". (The Skull & Shackles rulebook introduced the rule "If you choose not to acquire a boon, it counts as failing to acquire it.")
