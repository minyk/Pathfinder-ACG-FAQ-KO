## `Biter`로 찾은 카드가 체크가 여러번인 몬스터면 모든 체크에 1d6을 더할 수 있나요(If the card that Biter lets you examine is a monster with multiple checks to defeat, do you get to add 1d6 to all of those checks)?

예.

> Yes.

> Resolution: On the ally Biter, change "add 1d6 to your check to defeat it" to "add 1d6 to your checks to defeat it".
