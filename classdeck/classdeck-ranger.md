## Can I play the Adamantine Poniard +1 on a check for its 1d4 if I've already played a weapon on the check?

You should be able to do that.

For your combat check, reveal this card to use your Strength or Melee skill + 1d4.

Discard this card to reduce Combat damage dealt to you by 2. You may play this card on a check even if you played a weapon that does not have the 2-Handed trait.

## Most cards that are displayed to add 3 to a skill go away at the end of the turn in which they're played, but Endurance goes away at the end of your turn. Is that right?

Nope. It should be like the others.
