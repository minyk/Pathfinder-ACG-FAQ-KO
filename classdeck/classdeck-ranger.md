## Should Arabundi's Mage Hunter role have only 11 power feats?

Nope. He should have 12 like everyone else.

## If Arabundi the Nature Adept has his fifth and sixth powers fully checked, can he make an infinite loop of recharging a spell, putting it on top of his deck, drawing it, and repeating?

Not anymore.

Resolution: On the Nature Adept side of Arabundi's role card, change "When you would recharge a spell, you may shuffle it into your deck (▢ or put it on top of your deck) instead" to "When you would recharge a spell, you may display it instead. Before you reset your hand, shuffle it into your deck (▢ or put it on top of your deck)".

## Can I play Main-Gauche with another weapon or not? The first sentence tells me when I can't, not when I can.

You can, so long as you didn't play another weapon with the 2-Handed trait.

Resolution: On the weapon Main-Gauche, replace the text with the following:

For your combat check, reveal this card to use your Strength or Melee skill + 1d4.

Discard this card to reduce Combat damage dealt to you by 2. You may play this card on a check even if you played a weapon that does not have the 2-Handed trait.

Resolution: On the weapon Main-Gauche +1, replace the text with the following:

For your combat check, reveal this card to use your Strength or Melee skill + 1d4+1.

Recharge this card to reduce Combat damage dealt to you by 2. You may play this card on a check even if you played a weapon that does not have the 2-Handed trait.

## Most cards that are displayed to add 3 to a skill go away at the end of the turn in which they're played, but Endurance goes away at the end of your turn. Is that right?

Nope. It should be like the others.

Resolution: On the spell Endurance, change "At the end of your turn" to "At the end of the turn".
