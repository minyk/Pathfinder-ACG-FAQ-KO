## Can the Adamantine Trident +3 ignore difficulty-increasing powers for any monster encountered by anyone? And do I ignore the whole power, or just the part that increases the difficulty?

This power is intended to be part of the power above it, affecting only the monsters you are currently attempting a combat check against. And you may only ignore the part of the power that increases the difficulty.

Resolution: On the weapon Adamantine Trident +3, change "If a monster has a power that increases the difficulty of any combat check, ignore that power" to "If a monster has an effect that increases the difficulty of this check, ignore that effect", and move that sentence to the end of the first power.

## If I don't have the Arcane or Divine skill, can I really just discard the spell Masterwork when I play it? I'm used to banishing spells like that.

You need to banish it.

Resolution: On the spell Masterwork, add the italicized portion to the following text: "At the start of your turn, if you do not have either the Arcane or Divine skill, banish this card; otherwise, attempt an Arcane or Divine 12 check. If you succeed, recharge this card; if you fail, discard it."
