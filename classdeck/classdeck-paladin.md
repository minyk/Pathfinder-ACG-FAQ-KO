# 팔라딘 클래스 덱(Paladin Class Deck)

## `Mace of Smiting`전투 체크의 난이도를 증가시키는 몬스터의 효과를 무시하라는 파워가 있습니다. 여기에는, 예를 들면 전투 체크에 영향을 준다는 언급이 없는 `Veteran` 특성이 있는 몬스터처럼 난이도가 올라가는 것도 포함하나요(Mace of Smiting says I can ignore a monster's effects that increase the difficulty of a combat check. Does that include, for example, the difficulty increase from a monster with the Veteran trait, even though that power doesn't specifically say it affects combat checks)?

예. 난이도를 어렵게 만드는 모든 파워를 무시하는 것이 맞습니다.

> Yes. We want you to ignore any effects from monsters that would make your combat check more difficult.

> Resolution: On the weapon Mace of Smiting, replace "If a monster has an effect that increases the difficulty of a combat check, ignore that effect" with "If a monster has an effect that increases the difficulty of that check, ignore that effect".

## `Riding Horse` 혹은 `Griffon`을 현재 위치에 아무도 없을 때에도 사용할 수 있나요? 다른 캐릭터가 있다면 반드시 같이 이동해야 하나요(Can I use Riding Horse or Griffon to move when there's nobody else at my location? If there are other characters at my location, do I have to move 1 of them)?

이동할 때, 다른 캐릭터와 같이 움직일 필요는 없습니다.

> You do not have to move another character when you move.

> Resolution: On the ally Riding Horse, change the first power to "At the end of your turn, discard this card to move; you may also move another character at your location to your new location." On the ally Griffon, change the first power to "At the start or end of your turn, discard this card to move; you may also move another character at your location to your new location."
