## Mace of Smiting says I can ignore a monster's effects that increase the difficulty of a combat check. Does that include, for example, the difficulty increase from a monster with the Veteran trait, even though that power doesn't specifically say it affects combat checks?

Yes. We want you to ignore any effects from monsters that would make your combat check more difficult.

Resolution: On the weapon Mace of Smiting, replace "If a monster has an effect that increases the difficulty of a combat check, ignore that effect" with "If a monster has an effect that increases the difficulty of that check, ignore that effect".

## Can I use Riding Horse or Griffon to move when there's nobody else at my location? If there are other characters at my location, do I have to move 1 of them?

You do not have to move another character when you move.

Resolution: On the ally Riding Horse, change the first power to "At the end of your turn, discard this card to move; you may also move another character at your location to your new location." On the ally Griffon, change the first power to "At the start or end of your turn, discard this card to move; you may also move another character at your location to your new location."
