# 규칙 질문(Rules Questions)

## 어드벤처 패스의 첫 번째 챕터를 시작하기 전에 클래스 0 배 프로모션 카드를 박스에 추가할 수 았는지 없는지 모르겠습니다(I'm confused about whether or not I can add Class 0 ship promo cards to the box before I begin the first chapter of the Adventure Path).

함대 카드에 동일한 클래스의 다른 배를 체크하자마자 바로 프로모션 배 카드를 추가할 수 있습니다(You can add a ship promo card as soon as you have another ship of the same class checked off on your fleet card).

해결 방법: 규칙책 4쪽의 마지막 문단을 다음으로 교체합니다(Resolution: On page 4 of the rulebook, replace the last paragraph above Organizing Your Cards with the following):

> We have also published a number of promotional cards; these are marked with the letter P in the upper-right corner. If you have a character promo card, you can use it right away. If you have a ship promo card, as soon as you have checked off any ships of the same class on your fleet card, you may treat the promo card as if it has been checked off as well (see Place Your Party’s Ship on page 7). You shouldn’t add other promo cards to the game until you begin the first chapter of the Adventure Path.

## 시작 할 때 캐릭터의 페이버릿 카드를 받지 못 했고, 그리고 전체 덱을 사용했어도 유효한 시작 손 패를 얻지 못 했을 때 옆으로 치워 놓은 카드를 섞어서 쓸 수 있나요(If I don't draw my favored card type in my starting hand, but I don't go through my entire deck before I get a valid starting hand, do I get to shuffle in the cards I set aside while I was trying to get a valid hand)?

당연히 그렇습니다(Of course! That would be a silly thing to penalize you for).

해결 방법: 규칙 책 7쪽의 시작 손 패를 얻는 규칙의 마지막 문자을 다음과 같이 교체합니다(Resolution: On page 7 of the rulebook, replace the last sentence of Draw Starting Hands with the following):

> If you discard so many cards that you can’t draw up to your full hand size, draw all the remaining cards, then shuffle your discard pile into your deck, and draw the rest of your hand. Once you have a full hand that includes your favored card type, shuffle any discarded cards back into your character deck.

## 움직(또는 카드를 주거나, 모험을 하거나 장소를 닫기)이지 않기로 했을 때에도 턴에는 이동(또는 카드는 주는, 모험을 하는, 장소를 닫는) 단계가 있나요? 움직일떄 받을 수 있는 어떤 불이익을 피하기 위해서 이동을 하지 않을 수 있나요(If I choose not to move (or give a card, or explore, or close a location), do I still have a move (or give a card, or explore, or close a location) step in my turn? If something bad would happen during my move step, can I avoid it by not moving)?

아무 것도 하지 않아도 모든 단계는 존재 합니다. 안타깝지만 그렇게 쉽게 피할 수 없습니다(All steps exist, even if you don't do anything in them. Sorry—you don't get to avoid it that easily).

해결 방법: 규칙 책 8쪽 `당신의 턴` 항목에서 "The only required steps..." 문장을 삭제합니다(Resolution: On page 8 of the S&S rulebook, under Your Turn, delete the sentence that begins "The only required steps...").

## 언제 쓸 수 있는지 써 있지 않는 파워가 있을 때 어떤 상황에서 얼마나 많이 쓸 수 있나요(If I have a power that doesn't say when it can be used, when, under what circumstances, and how many times can it be used)?

파워를 쓸 수 있는 때마다 허용된 만큼 많이 사용할 수 있습니다. 만일 각 단계의 사이에서 사용한다면 몇 번이던 사용할 수 있습니다. 그렇지만 하나의 체크나 단계 동안에서는 단 한 번만 사용할 수 있습니다(Whenever you could otherwise use a power, when it makes sense, and as many times as is allowed. If you use it in between steps, you can use it any number of times. But if you use it during a check or step, only once).

해결 방안: 규칙 책 8쪽의 `당신의 턴` 항목의 첫 번째 문단의 마지막에 다음을 추가합니다(Resolution: On page 8 of the S&S rulebook, under Your Turn, add the following to the end of the first paragraph): 

> "You can play cards and use powers without limit in between these steps, as long as they don't say they can only be played at certain times."

## 현재 있는 장소로 이동할 수 있습니까(Can I choose to move to the location I'm currently at)?

아니오. 무작위로 이동하는 몇몇 효과는 당신이 이미 있는 장소로 이동 시킬 수도 있지만, 이동 장소를 선택할 때에는 항상 다른 장소를 선택해야 합니다(No. Some effect may randomly move you to the location you're already at, but when you choose to move, you must always choose a different location).

해결 방법: 규칙 책 8쪽의 `이동` 항목에서 다음의 문장을 대체합니다:(Resolution: On page 8 of the rulebook, under Move, replace the parenthetical sentence):


> If you do not move, your character is not considered to have entered or left a location

에서

> When you choose to move, you must always select a new location, although it is possible for some effects to move you to the same location you came from. If you do not change locations, your character is not considered to have entered or left a location.

## 카드에서 다시 탐험할 수 있다고 하는 경우, 탐험하기 전에 카드나 파워를 사용할 수 있나요? 그리고 카드에서 `다시 "즉시" 탐험`이라고 말하는 것과 차이가 있습니까(When a card tells me to explore again, can I play cards or use powers before I explore? And does it make a difference if the card says to "immediately" explore again)?

아니오-양쪽 모두 당신이 다음에 할 수 있는 것은 탐험이며, 그 전에 다른 것은 할 수 없습니다(Nope—either way, the next thing you do is explore, and you can't do anything before that).

해결 방법: 규칙 책 9쪽의 문장에 다음을 더합니다(Resolution: On page 9 of the rulebook, following the paragraph that begins)
 
> "However, during a single exploration, no matter how many different effects allow you to explore again..."

에

> "If a card grants you an additional exploration, after you finish what you are doing, you must immediately use that exploration or forfeit it." 

향후에는 `즉시`라는 단어를 삭제 할 예정입니다(We will also be removing the word "immediately" from such cards in the future).

## There are times when I'm directed to reset my hand outside of the "Reset Your Hand" step, and I'm not sure exactly which parts of that step I am supposed to do. Also, it seems weird that powers that happen at the end of your turn actually happen during the Reset Your Hand step, which is before the End Your Turn step.

Let's fix both of those things. Note that while there's a lot of text in this resolution, the main thing that's changing is merely organizational—the same things happen in the same order as they do now.

Resolution: Reset Your Hand will no longer be a step in the turn sequence, so its text should be removed from page 9 of the rulebook. Instead, it should be a general rules section, much like Taking Damage or Examining and Searching. (We'll insert it after Examining and Searching on page 14.) It should read:

Reset Your Hand: Do the following whenever you are instructed to reset your hand. While you reset your hand, you may only play cards or use powers that say they may be used when you reset your hand. First, you may discard any number of cards. Then, if you have more cards in your hand than your hand size specifies, you must discard until the number of cards in your hand matches your hand size. Finally, if you have fewer cards than your hand size, you must draw cards until the number of cards in your hand matches your hand size.

On page 9 of the rulebook, The End Your Turn step should now read:

End Your Turn: First, apply any effects that happen at the end of the turn. While you do this, unless a power directed you to end your turn, you may play cards and use powers. Then, reset your hand (see Reset Your Hand). When you’re done, the turn passes to the player on your left.
On the back cover of the rulebook, under Turn Overview, replace the Reset Your Hand and End Your Turn entries with the following:

End Your Turn—apply end-of-turn effects, then reset your hand by first discarding any number of cards then discarding down to or drawing up to your hand size.

(Note that because resetting your hand is now included in ending your turn, future printings of cards that said "reset your hand and end your turn" will just say "end your turn.")

## 디스플레이되어 있는 카드의 파워를 발동하는 것은 그 카드를 사용하는 것으로 간주하나요(Does activating a power on a displayed card count as playing it)?

예, 그렇습니다(Yes, it does).

Resolution: On page 9 of the rulebook, under Playing Cards, after the sentence that begins "Playing a card means using a power on that card..." add the sentence "Activating a power on a displayed card also counts as playing it."

## 카드를 버릴 때 발동되는 파워를 가지고 있으면, 체크나 단계 당 오직 한번만 수행해야 하나요(If I have a power that says it happens when I discard a card (or roll on the plunder table, or something else I might do a lot), can I really only do it once per check or step)?

만일 파워의 설명이 `[어떤 일]이 발생할 때`로 시작하면 체크나 단계 동안 여러번 발생한다 하더라도 그 일이 벌어질 때마다 매번 할 수 있습니다(If a power begins with `when [something happens]`, you can do it every time that thing happens, even if it happens multiple times during a check or step).

Resolution: On page 9 of the Skull & Shackles rulebook, under Playing Cards, change "A specific card’s power may only be used once per check or step" to "If a power says it may be used when something happens, you may use it every time that happens. Otherwise, a specific card’s power may only be used once per check or step."

## 파워를 사용하기 위해서 카드를 리빌할 때 손 패에 어떤 일이 발생한다면, 리빌한 카드는 손 패에 있는 카드인가요(If I reveal a card for a power, and then something messes with my hand, is the revealed card in my hand? What if I display it? If I discard a card that could be recharged, but something messes with my discard pile before I can make the check to recharge it, is the card really in the discard pile)?

카드를 리빌하거나 디스플레이하는 것은 즉시 발생됩니다. 모든 다른 액션은 당신이 그 것이 어떤 액션인지 알 때까지 대기합니다(Revealing and displaying happen instantly. Every other action waits until you know what action it really is).

Resolution: On page 10 of the rulebook, after the bulleted list of possible actions, add the following: "When you reveal a card, it does not leave your hand. When you display a card, it leaves your hand immediately. When you play a card by performing any other action, set it aside while you process its effects. For example, a spell might tell you to discard it, then allow you to succeed at a check to recharge it instead; set it aside until you resolve the check that determines whether or not you recharge it. While set aside, a card does not count as being in your hand, your discard pile, your deck, or anywhere else.

## 어떤 카드가 `이 카드를 리차지하여 당신의 버린 더미에 있는 카드를 라치지합니다`라고 한다면 어떤 카드를 먼저 리차지해야 합니까(If a card says something like "Recharge this card to recharge a card from your discard pile," in what order do I put the recharged cards on the bottom of my deck)?

먼저 발생한 액션을 먼저 합니다. 손에서 사용한 카드가 먼저 덱의 밑 바닥으로 가고, 버린 더미에서 온 카드가 그 밑으로 놓여집니다.

> Do the first action first. The card from your hand will go to the bottom of your deck first, and the card from your discard pile will end up below it.

> Resolution: On page 10 of the Skull & Shackles rulebook, after the bulleted list of actions (and after the added text from the FAQ entry above), add:

> Always perform the first action required by a power before performing any other action. For example, if a card says "Recharge this card to recharge a card from your discard pile," recharge the card you're playing before recharging the card from your discard pile.

## Something made a card go back in the box or into a deck even though there were still things on the card that hadn't been done. Do I still do those things?

Yes.

Resolution: On page 10 of the Skull & Shackles rulebook, after the bulleted list of actions (and after the added text from the two FAQ entries above), add the following text: "Cards often have instructions that you need to follow after you play the card; follow these instructions even if the card is no longer in your hand (even if the card is out of your sight, such as in the box or in a deck)."

> It's neither defeated nor undefeated, and it gets shuffled back into the location deck it came from (or if it was summoned, it gets banished).

> Resolution: On page 11 of the rulebook, at the end of the Resolve the Encounter section, add "If you are forced to end your turn during an encounter, shuffle the encountered card back into the deck, or if it was summoned, banish it; it is neither defeated nor undefeated, and the encounter is over."

## If a barrier tells me that I have to encounter it "as my first exploration" on a turn, but I have a power says that I can do something "instead of my first exploration," if I use my power, does that mean I can then explore and not face the barrier?

Sorry—no. The first time you actually explore, you have to deal with that barrier.

Resolution: On page 11 of the rulebook, in the Rules: Faceup Cards sidebar, replace "If such a card tells you that you must encounter it on your first exploration on a turn, then after that exploration, ignore it for the purpose of additional explorations that turn; however, it still counts as the top card of the deck for any other purpose" with "If such a card tells you that you must encounter it on your first exploration on a turn, then you must encounter it the first time you explore that turn. After that exploration, ignore it for the purpose of additional explorations that turn; however, it still counts as the top card of the deck for any other purpose".

아니오 그렇지 않습니다. 탐험당 하나씩입니다.

> Oh, geez, no. One per exploration.

> Resolution: On page 11 of the rulebook, in the Faceup Cards sidebar, change the last sentence to the following: "If multiple cards are left faceup on the same deck, you may place them in any order and encounter them in that order, one per exploration.

## If a card requires sequential checks, and more than one character is attempting them, who does "you" on that card refer to: the person attempting the check, or the person encountering the card?

The person attempting the check.

Resolution: On page 12 of the rulebook, near the top of the page, at the end of the paragraph that begins "Only the character who encounters the card...", add the following sentence:

"While you are attempting a check against such a card that you did not encounter, powers that would apply to the character who encountered it apply to you instead."

## When a power adds a skill to a check, does it change the type of check? For example, if I power up an Alchemist's Fire to add my Craft skill to a combat check, does that make it a Craft check?

No. When a power says you may use a skill for a check (like most weapons and attack spells), it adds the skills you're using as traits to the check, but when you're just adding another skill to a check, those skills are not added as traits.

Resolution:

On page 12 of the rulebook, under "Determine Which Skill You're Using," replace the first two paragraphs with the three that follow. (This might seem like a big change, but mostly, we've taken the opportunity to rewrite and reorganize this section for clarity and to add some more examples. The most significant additions are the last two sentences, and even these are just to clarify that a thing doesn't happen; since nothing ever suggested it did happen, none of this actually changes gameplay at all.)

Determine Which Skill You’re Using. Cards that require a check specify the skill or skills you can use to attempt the check. Each check to defeat or acquire a card lists one or more skills; you may choose any of the listed skills for your check. For example, if a check lists Dexterity, Disable, Strength, and Melee, you may use any one of those skills to attempt your check. Even if your character doesn’t have any of the skills listed for a check, you can still attempt the check, but your die is a d4.

Some cards allow you to use a particular skill for a specific type of check, or to use one skill instead of another. (These cards generally say things like "For your combat check, use your Strength or Melee skill," or "Use your Strength skill instead of your Diplomacy skill.") You may play only 1 such card or use only 1 such power to determine which skill you're using. A few cards that can be used on checks don’t use any of your skills; they instead specify the exact dice you need to roll or the result of your die roll.

The skill you're using for the check, and any skill referenced by that skill, are added as traits to the check. For example, if your character has the skill Melee: Strength +2, and you are using your Melee skill, both the Strength and the Melee traits are added to the check. When you're playing a card to determine the skill you're using, that card’s traits are also added to the check; for example, revealing the weapon Dragon Pistol for your combat check adds the Firearm, Ranged, Piercing, and Elite traits to the check. (This isn’t the same as giving you a skill; for example, playing the spell Fireblade adds the Divine trait to your check, but it does not give you the Divine skill.) If a power adds an additional skill to a check, that skill is not added as a trait to the check. For example, a card that adds your Craft skill to your combat check does not add the Craft trait to your check.

## When a card requires me to determine the highest difficulty of a card, what modifiers affect that difficulty?

Anything that doesn't occur before, while, or after you act. For example, most cards with the Veteran trait will increase in difficulty with the adventure deck number, but if the difficulty of a check would be increased only if you fail a check before you act, that doesn't apply here.

Resolution: On page 12 of the rulebook, at the end of "Determine the difficulty," add the following sentence:

"When determining the lowest or highest difficulty to defeat or acquire a card, apply all powers from cards in play that affect the difficulty, but do not apply powers that happen before you act, while you act, or after you act."

Also, for all banes with the Lycanthrope trait in Skull & Shackles and Rise of the Runelords, plus the ship Blood Moon from Skull & Shackles Adventure Deck 4, remove the words "Before you act" or "Before the encounter" from the power that requires you to look at the top card of the blessings discard pile.

The complete list of affected cards:

Rise of the Runelords: monster Werewolf (B & C), henchman Pidget Tergelson (2)
Skull & Shackles: monster Blood Moon Pirate (B), monster Werecrocodile (3), villain Fargo Vitterande (4), ship Blood Moon (4), henchman Wereshark Pirate (6), villain Captain Horrus Riptooth (6)

## The rules say that summoned cards are banished "unless I'm instructed otherwise," but it's not clear what counts as being instructed otherwise. For example, if my character has a power that lets him put a monster into his hand, does that apply to summoned monsters?

No. The only cards that are allowed to "instruct you otherwise" are the cards actually doing the summoning.

Resolution: On page 14 of the Skull & Shackles Rulebook, under Summoning and Adding Cards, change "After evading a summoned card or resolving the encounter with it, banish it unless you’re instructed otherwise" to "After evading a summoned card or resolving the encounter with it, never put it anywhere other than back in the box unless the card that caused you to summon it instructs you otherwise".

## The rules say that summoned cards can never summon other cards, but The Secret of Mancatcher Cove summons and builds a location, and a card in that location is supposed to summon a card. Isn't that a problem?

Not if cards in summoned locations don't count as summoned cards...

Resolution: On page 15 of the rulebook, add the italicized text to the following sentence: "If you’re told to summon and build a location, retrieve the location card from the box and build the location as usual; the location and its deck remain in play for the rest of the scenario and are no longer considered summoned cards."

## In a scenario with multiple villains, if more than one is in the same location, and all other locations are closed, that location doesn't get closed. So when you defeat one villain, he will always escape back to it, leaving multiple villains as the only cards in the deck for the rest of the game, rendering the scenario unwinnable. That's bad, right?

Yeah, that's not good. We've been careful to engineer scenarios to avoid that issue, but a change to the rulebook should address that problem for good.

Resolution: On page 16 of the rulebook, under If You Defeat the Villain, Close the Villain’s Location, change "... the location is not permanently closed, but it is temporarily closed, and the defeated villain cannot escape to it" to "...the location is not permanently closed, but if there are no other open locations for the villain to escape to, banish the villain".

예.

> Yes. (The resolution below looks like a bigger deal than it is; the only actual change is that we're now covering that one case in the question. But since we can tighten things up while we're adding that, we will!)

> Resolution: On page 17 of the rulebook, replace the text under Commanding and Moving Ships with the following:

> Characters at the same location as the party's ship are on the ship. Characters at other locations are not on the ship.

> If your ship is not anchored, whenever it is your turn, you are commanding the ship. If you move or are moved while commanding the ship, other characters on the ship may choose to move with you. Effects that restrict movement still apply—if something prevents you from moving, you can’t move; if something is preventing another character at your location from moving, that character cannot move with you. Any character who does not move with you is no longer on the ship.

> If your ship is anchored, you are commanding the ship only when it is your turn and you are at the ship's location. You may not choose to move an anchored ship. If your character moves or is moved from the ship’s location, you are no longer on the ship or commanding it, and other characters may not choose to move with you.

## If I have no cards in my deck, can I avoid dying by triggering a power that allows me to draw a card from an empty blessings deck so my party loses the scenario before I have to draw from my deck?

Nice try, but no. If you must draw a card from an empty blessings deck, you must end your turn before the scenario ends.

Resolution: On page 18 of the Skull & Shackles rulebook, change "If at any point, you need to advance the blessing deck but there are no cards remaining in it, the scenario ends immediately and your party of adventurers loses." to "If at any point you need to advance the blessing deck but there are no cards remaining in it, immediately end the current turn; the scenario then ends and your party of adventurers loses."

## What's a ship feat? And when I gain a Class 2 ship feat, can I check off a Class 1 ship if I prefer?

Various scenarios and adventures reward your party with a ship feat, which allows you to check a box of a particular class of ship on the fleet card. And yes, you may choose a ship of a lower class if you like.

Resolution: On page 19 of the rulebook, change "Your party may be rewarded with a ship; check off an appropriate ship on the party’s fleet card" to "Your party may be rewarded with a ship feat; check off an appropriate ship of the indicated class or lower on the party’s fleet card."

## 체크당 하나 이상의 `루트`를 사용할 수 있나요(Can I play more than one loot per check)?

`루트`의 타입이 다르다면 사용할 수 있습니다.

> Yes, as long as they're different types of loot. A loot card functions as the other type of boon that it is for purposes of whether you can play more than one of each type. So if you have two loot weapons, you can't play both on a check, but if you have a loot weapon and a loot item, you can play both on that check.

> Resolution: On page 24 of the Skull & Shackles rulebook, under Loot, change "loot cards behave just like other boons of that type and count as cards of that type" to "loot cards behave just like other boons of that type and count as cards of that type rather than loot when played."

## When a bane has a power that triggers when "you" do something, does "you" mean just the person encountering the bane, or anybody doing that thing?

It applies to anybody who does that thing.

## In the Example of Play, some of the players forget to recharge the cards they play, one player leaves out a die when she rolls, and the word "banished" is used with a card that should be discarded.

Sigh. While it's true that players sometimes forget to recharge the cards they play, and occasionally leave out dice, that doesn't really make for a good example.

Resolution: In the Example of Play on pages 26 and 27, change the following. (This entry is lengthy, though the only mechanical changes are the bolded bits below.)

In Lily's first turn, replace the two paragraphs where Alahazra and Seltyiel encounter the Buccaneer with the following:

First, Seltyiel encounters his copy of the Buccaneer. He has a Force Missile and a Longsword in his hand, so he activates a character power that lets him use both cards. He uses the Force Missile for his combat check, which adds 2d4 to his Arcane skill of d8+3, and recharges the Longsword to add 1d6. Now Sam rolls 1d8+3 + 2d4 + 1d6, but manages a measly 7, which doesn’t beat the Buccaneer’s difficulty of 8. Sam must now discard 1 card (the difference between the 8 he needed and the 7 he rolled). He discards the ally Quartermaster, and the Buccaneer he summoned is banished. Now he must succeed at an Arcane 6 check or discard the Force Missile instead of recharging it; he beats that handily and puts the card under his deck.

Next, Alahazra encounters her copy of the Buccaneer. She plays the spell Fear to evade it. Normally, Fear would shuffle an evaded monster into an open location deck, but the summoned monster didn’t come from a location deck, so it’s banished instead. She recharges Fear.

In Amber's First Turn, make these adjustments:

Change "2d12+4 + 1d4" to "2d12+4 + 1d6 + 1d4.”
Change "She draws back up to her hand size and ends her turn" to "She recharges Inflict, draws back up to her hand size, and ends her turn".

Card Questions: Skull & Shackles Base Set
If I use Jirelle the Pirate Queen's last power, who can move, and when?
If you check the first box, Jirelle can move at the end of her turn if she is at the ship's location (and if the ship isn't anchored, she can take anyone at her location with her). If you check the second box, anyone on the ship with Jirelle can move at the end of his turn (and if the ship isn't anchored, that person can take Jirelle and anyone else at his location with him).

## The Home Sweet Home scenario calls for the henchmen Gholdako and Ghol-Gon Obelisks. Deck 4 contains 6 Gholdakos, but only one Obelisk.

Due to a printer error, adventure deck 4 of Skull & Shackles, Island of Empty Eyes, included 6 copies of the henchman Gholdako and 1 copy of the henchman Ghol-Gan Obelisk; it should have had 6 Ghol-Gan Obelisks and 1 Gholdako. And due to our own error, it has 1 fewer Blink Spider than you’ll need when you have 6 players.

We have solved this problem by making a pack of cards that includes 5 Ghol-Gan Obelisks, 1 Blink Spider, and—in the interest of turning lemons into lemonade—The Land of the Blind, a brand-new scenario that makes use of those extra Gholdako cards. We provided that for free to customers who purchased Island of Empty Eyes from paizo.com, we sent copies through our distributors, and we inserted the pack into our remaining stock of the Island of Empty Eyes Adventure Deck.

If you need to play the scenario "Home Sweet Home" without access to that pack, we suggest proxying with Buccaneers (that is, setting the Ghol-Gan Obelisk to the side, adding Buccaneers to the location decks instead, and referring to the Obelisk whenever you find a Buccaneer).

Cards listed as "Retail Promo" will be made available to game stores during the indicated month.

Pathfinder Adventure Card Game subscribers will be shipped promo cards along with their subscription orders (The first 6 cards ship with the subscription shipment containing the Character Add-On Deck; the next card with the next subscription shipment, and so on). A copy of Blessing of Zogmugot will ship with each subscription shipment from October to February.

Due to a printer error, adventure deck 4 of Skull & Shackles, Island of Empty Eyes, included 6 copies of the henchman Gholdako and 1 copy of the henchman Ghol-Gan Obelisk; it should have had 6 Ghol-Gan Obelisks and 1 Gholdako. And due to our own error, it has 1 fewer Blink Spider than you’ll need when you have 6 players. We solved this problem by making a pack of cards that includes 5 Ghol-Gan Obelisks, 1 Blink Spider, and—in the interest of turning lemons into lemonade—The Land of the Blind, a brand-new promo scenario that makes use of those extra Gholdako cards. We provided that pack for free to customers who purchased Island of Empty Eyes from paizo.com, sent copies through our distributors, and inserted it into our remaining stock of the Island of Empty Eyes Adventure Deck. (The cards in this pack are not usable without the Island of Empty Eyes Adventure Deck, and only one pack is needed per adventure deck.)
